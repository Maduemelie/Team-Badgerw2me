👥 Collaboration
For TeamBadgerw2, follow the following steps to collaborate:

1] Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website: https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-Badgerw2

2] Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*

3] Make a local clone: Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-Badgerw2.git"

Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location In your Terminal, type: git clone https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-Badgerw2.git

4] Open terminal and set upstream branch: git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-Badgerw2

5] Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo: git pull upstream main

6] Create a new branch for the task you are working on : git checkout -b branchName (Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using git status before you begin working)

When you're done with your task, do:
git add
    Commit your work with a message:
    git commit -m "message"

To avoid conflicts:
git pull upstream main

Then push your branch:
git push origin branchName - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github

Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
If you need to make an update, repeat from no 4
